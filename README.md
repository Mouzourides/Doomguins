# react-boilerplate

Get started quick with react-boilerplate! By default react-boilerplate comes pre-configured with: redux, routes, flow, antd and prettier.

#### Want redux and routes but not flow? No problem!

Just run `git checkout react-redux-routes`

#### Want react without redux, routes and flow? No problem!

Just run `git checkout react-basic`
